# What: Flashcards to PDF

Flashcards to PDF is a project exploring jsPDF, a client-side JavaScript library for generating PDFs. The goal was to create an application that allows users to create flashcards they can use to study. 

## Why: Experimentation!

Because being able to generate PDFs from JavaScript is cool. This is a demo of the library to test out its capabilities and explore what I could do. This could pave the path for generating printable tickets, QR codes, information pamphlets, etc. 

## How: Setup and Install
* `git clone` the repository on your machine
* Run `npm install` to install the necessary packages
* Run `ng serve` for the Angular dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200`. The app will automatically reload when the source files are changed
